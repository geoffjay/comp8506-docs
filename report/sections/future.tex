\section{Future Work}\label{sec:future}

  The scope of what is possible to achieve in this project is far beyond what a
  single individual could accomplish in one year. There are many ideas and
  concepts that came up during this project that were identified as being
  valuable to accomplish in future iterations. This section lists some of those
  that the developer plans to implement going forward.

  \subsection{Meson Build System}\label{sec:future-meson}

    The Autotools build system is somewhat complex and difficult to maintain.
    More modern build systems have emerged such as \texttt{waf} and
    \testtt{meson} that would likely provide a much easier system for new
    contributors to modify as well as improve on the time required to perform a
    build.

    Objectives:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Reduce build time
      \item Simplify additions and modifications to the build system
    \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Plugin Generator}\label{sec:future-plugin-generator}

    Objectives:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item \ldots
    \end{itemize}

  \subsection{CLI Tool}\label{sec:future-cli}

    Objectives:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item \ldots
    \end{itemize}

  \subsection{GUI Integration}\label{sec:future-gui}

    Objectives:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item \ldots
    \end{itemize}
