\section{Timeline}\label{sec:timeline}

  The major work units within the project work timeline has been listed as
  version numbers to coincide with the release tracking that took place in the
  project management software named `redmine'.

  The total time that was proposed to complete this project was 450 hours. This
  was based off of the expected deliverables as well as the amount of work that
  was deemed feasible to perform above a regular 40 hour work week. The actual
  hours spent on the project were tracked with reasonable accuracy in a project
  management system, the total resulting in approximately 624 hours. The
  additional time on the project was the result of an underestimation in the
  amount of time that would be spent writing the report, as well as the amount
  spent during the requirements and design phases.

  It should be noted that any task containing zero hours for time spent was due
  to the work to be done on those being made irrelevant through the course of
  performing one of the other tasks. All tasks as initially proposed were
  satisfied, but some became larger than originally envisioned.
